# Bakery Ordering and Billing System

This program, developed in C++ language as my Class 12th Project, is a simple example of the commercial programs used in the online food ordering websites. Specifically I have taken the topic, “Online Bakery Website”, as a project, developed to nurture the customer’s needs by embedding all the tasks of selecting, ordering and billing in the program.

## Features of the program

1. Customer Login
2. Bakery History and Menu Display
3. Selection of the items by customer
4. Billing of the items
5. Provision of Invoice
6. Feedbacks by customers provision  

This program provides data security, minimizes manual data entry and the time required for various data processing. It is user-friendly, effective and interactive.

### Software Used

Turbo C++ Version 3.0, Borland International, Inc.

### Suggested Enhancements

My program is a simple demo version of a bakery online food ordering system and has most of the simple necessary features of it like, login of the customer, display of bakery history and menu, selection and billing of the purchased items and feedback facility. As I am only a beginner in the C++ language, my program is not 100% efficient and has several drawbacks as well, which I hope to remove. My program can be improved and made more versatile by using concepts of object oriented programming and data file handling.
